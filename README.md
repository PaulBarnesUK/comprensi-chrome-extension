# Language Level for YouTube

This Chrome extension is for language learners using YouTube for comprehensible input. It overlays community-sourced language level indicators onto video thumbnails, helping you to gauge whether a video matches your level **before** you watch it. The goal is to make finding level-appropriate content less time-consuming.

By comparing videos you've watched, you contribute to the community ratings system. This collaborative approach means the more you use it, the better it becomes for everyone. Each comparison you make helps refine the language level indicators, creating a continuously improving resource for the entire language learning community.

## How It Works

![Language level indicators on YouTube thumbnails](/docs/images/screenshot-thumbnails.png)

The extension shows language level indicators on YouTube thumbnails with scores like "54/100". These scores are **relative** - they only show how difficult a video is compared to other videos in the system, not absolute difficulty categories.

However, to help give you a rough idea at a glance the indicator has a coloured progress bar based on the video's level:

- Green bars generally indicate the easiest content ![Total Beginner Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-total-beginner.png)
- Blue bars suggest beginner-friendly videos ![Beginner Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-beginner.png)
- Yellow bars show intermediate difficulty ![Intermediate Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-intermediate.png)
- Red bars point to more challenging content ![Intermediate Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-advanced.png)
- Purple bars typically mark the most difficult videos ![Expert Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-expert.png)

When you watch videos, you'll occasionally be asked which one was harder to understand. Your answers help build this relative scoring system and improve the indicators for everyone.

## FAQ

### I don't see any level indicators, what's up??

Indicators are only displayed once enough comparisons have been gathered that the system is confident in the video's difficulty level. As a result, early users will see fewer indicators while the system builds up data. I have imported data from <https://comprensi.com> for Spanish, but the data is still very sparse.

## Development

## 🎯 How It Works

When you browse YouTube, you'll see **difficulty scores (0–100)** over video thumbnails.
These scores are based on real user feedback and will help you find the best comprehensible input fast.

After watching a video, you might occasionally get a quick prompt asking which of two videos was easier to understand. These tiny comparisons help refine the system — making the scores even better for you and others.

(Under the hood, it uses the [TrueSkill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill) to smartly estimate difficulty based on user feedback.)

## ❓ FAQ

### I don't see any difficulty scores, what's up??

Difficulty scores are only displayed once enough comparisons have been gathered that the system is confident in the video's difficulty. As a result, early users will see fewer indicators while the system builds up data. I have imported data from <https://comprensi.com> for Spanish, but the data is still very sparse.

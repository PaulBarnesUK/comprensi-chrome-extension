# Language Level for YouTube

This Chrome extension is for language learners using YouTube for comprehensible input. It overlays community-sourced language level indicators onto video thumbnails, helping you to gauge whether a video matches your level _before_ you watch it.

It's all based on user feedback, so it'll ask you to compare 2 recent videos you've watched every now and then and that will be used to calculate the difficulty levels. It takes a few votes for it to be confident in a video's difficulty level but once it is, it'll show a little indicator over the video's thumbnail when browsing through YouTube.

**NOTE**: Right now, there is very little data in the system. **Early users can expect to see very few level indicators**. With more users and more feedback, the system will become more and more useful. So if you like the idea and have friends that you think would benefit, please share it with them! Together we can all contribute and help each other.

## How It Works

![Language level indicators on YouTube thumbnails](/docs/images/screenshot-thumbnails.png)

The extension shows language level indicators on YouTube thumbnails with scores like "54/100". These levels are **relative** - they only show how difficult a video is compared to other videos in the system, not absolute difficulty categories.

However, to help give you a rough idea at a glance the indicator has a coloured progress bar based on the video's level:

- Green bars generally indicate the easiest content ![Total Beginner Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-total-beginner.png)
- Blue bars suggest beginner-friendly videos ![Beginner Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-beginner.png)
- Yellow bars show intermediate difficulty ![Intermediate Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-intermediate.png)
- Red bars point to more challenging content ![Intermediate Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-advanced.png)
- Purple bars typically mark the most difficult videos ![Expert Indicator](/docs/images/screenshot-indicator-expert.png)

When you watch videos, you'll occasionally be asked which one was easier to understand. Your answers help build this relative scoring system and improve the indicators for everyone.

## FAQ

### I don't see any level indicators, what's up??

Indicators are only displayed once enough comparisons have been gathered that the system is confident in the video's difficulty level. As a result, early users will see fewer indicators while the system builds up data. I have imported data from <https://comprensi.com> for Spanish, but the data is still very sparse.

**Understand more, track your progress, and level‑up faster — all without leaving YouTube.**

Comprensi adds a smart overlay to YouTube that shows **video difficulty scores** _and_ automatically **tracks the minutes you spend with comprehensible input**. No more guessing which videos suit your current level or wondering if you’re putting in enough exposure each week — Comprensi does the heavy lifting so you can focus on learning.

## 🎯 How It Works

- **Difficulty Scoring** — Comprensi overlays a score (0–100) on every video thumbnail once enough data is available. The score is based on community comparisons that are processed with TrueSkill for robust estimates.
- **Time Tracking** — While you watch, Comprensi securely logs how many minutes you spend on videos in your chosen language(s). A weekly and all‑time tally is available in the popup so you can stick to your input goals.
- **Light Nudges** — After finishing a video you may occasionally see a super‑short prompt asking which of two videos was easier. Your answer sharpens future difficulty scores for everyone.

## 📚 Supported Languages

| -------- | ---- | --- | ---------- | ---- |
| Spanish  | 🇪🇸   |     | Portuguese | 🇧🇷   |

## ❓ FAQ

### I don’t see any difficulty scores yet. Is something wrong?

Scores appear only after enough comparison data has been gathered to make a confident estimate. Early adopters may see fewer scores while the system warms up. We’ve pre‑seeded Spanish with data from <https://comprensi.com>, but most other languages will need a little time to populate.

### Where is my watch‑time data stored?

All time‑tracking happens locally in your browser. Nothing is uploaded unless you explicitly opt into sync features (coming later). Your privacy is paramount.

### Does Comprensi work on mobile YouTube?

At the moment, Chrome extensions only run on desktop browsers.
